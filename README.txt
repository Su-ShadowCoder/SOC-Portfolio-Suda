Over the previous two weeks, I have been struggling to set up a SOC lab. I was initially thinking about going with Splunk, but apparently employers react very strongly if you know how to work with Microsoft Sentinel. So yes, I decided to go for Sentinel.

Soon, I found out why Sentinel is so valued, because getting started felt like being thrown into a labyrinth where your body apparently acts inversely to your mind. In other words, I was completely clueless. I would almost bet that Splunk is three times easier than working with Microsoft Sentinel.

Even though it took me a lot of time, I was eventually able to navigate my way through that mess. Of course, not by myself, but with my walking stick: ChatGPT. After asking questions, trying to understand the concepts, and watching YouTube videos that were mostly about older versions of Azure, I was able to learn how to set things up and reach a state where I was no longer a completely clueless rabbit.

After I finished everything last weekend, or maybe on Friday (I honestly do not remember anymore), I had to clean up all the screenshots I made for privacy reasons, just in case someone could misuse them. You never know. I mean, I am in the cybersecurity field, for goodness' sake.

Now I am finally submitting everything to Git. This week, I am planning to start doing smaller tasks, at least two times per week, to gain that juicy “hands-on” experience that employers want so badly.

Well, what else can I say? I guess that’s it for today, folks. See you on the other side, Neo.
